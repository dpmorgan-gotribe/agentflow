Conduct thorough market research for the project.

## Output Requirements

OUTPUT ONLY RAW MARKDOWN. No explanations. No descriptions.

Your response must:
- Start with: `# Competitive Research`
- Be valid Markdown content
- Follow the output format below exactly

DO NOT:
- Explain what you're creating
- Ask for permission
- Wrap in markdown code fences (```)
- Add any text before or after the markdown
- Say "Now I have..." or "Let me..." or "Here's the..."

## Process

1. **Identify Category**: What type of app is this? (social, fitness, e-commerce, productivity, etc.)

2. **Find Competitors**: Search for top apps in this category
   - Direct competitors (same feature set)
   - Indirect competitors (adjacent solutions)
   - Market leaders to learn from
   - Number of competitors to research: {styleCount - 1} (to generate that many research-inspired styles)

3. **Analyze Each Competitor**:
   - Core features and unique selling points
   - Visual design language (colors, typography, spacing)
   - User flow patterns (onboarding, core actions, monetization)
   - What they do well / pain points

4. **Industry Best Practices**:
   - UX patterns common in this category
   - Accessibility standards
   - Platform conventions (iOS/Android/Web)

5. **Market Gaps**: Opportunities the project could exploit
