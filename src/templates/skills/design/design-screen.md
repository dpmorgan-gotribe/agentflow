# Design Screen

Create a full screen design.

## Output Requirements

OUTPUT ONLY RAW HTML. No explanations. No descriptions.

Your response must:
- Start with: `<!DOCTYPE html>`
- End with: `</html>`
- Be a complete, valid HTML file
- Include inline CSS in a `<style>` tag
- Be directly viewable in a browser

DO NOT:
- Explain what you're creating
- Ask for permission
- Wrap in markdown code blocks
- Add any text before or after the HTML
- Say "I've created..." or "Here's the..."
- Include postamble like "This screen includes..." or "Let me know if..."

## Content Requirements

Single HTML file for one screen:
- Complete layout
- All components styled per stylesheet
- Realistic content
- All states if applicable (loading, error, empty)

## Key Rules

- Use stylesheet CSS variables
- Header/footer position:fixed
- Solid background colors on chrome
- Self-contained, no external deps
