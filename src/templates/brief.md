# Project Brief

Describe your project here. The analyst will extract what it needs.

Include whatever is relevant:
- What is being built and why
- Who will use it (audience, context, devices)
- Brand identity (name, colors, tone, logo location)
- Key features and user flows
- Technical constraints
- Design preferences

There is no required format. Write naturally, paste existing docs,
or structure it however makes sense for your project.
